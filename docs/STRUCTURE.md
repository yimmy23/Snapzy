## Implementation Notes That Matter

- `ScreenCaptureViewModel` is the main entrypoint for capture actions fired from shortcuts or the status bar menu.
- `AppStatusBarController` is the AppKit bridge for the menu bar item. It now keeps the menu accessible during active recording, renders the live recording timer from `ScreenRecordingManager`, and coordinates temporary Preferences-window exclusion for record-own-app sessions.
- Area screenshot now freezes the active display first through `FrozenAreaCaptureSession`, then keeps one overlay session that can toggle between manual region selection and application window selection with the configurable `Application Capture` overlay key. The default key is `A`.
- Area + inline annotate uses `InlineAreaAnnotateCoordinator` with `InlineAreaAnnotateSession` and `InlineAreaAnnotateWindow`. It starts after a frozen all-display snapshot set, creates coordinated per-display panels that share one desktop coordinate space, reuses Annotate state/canvas/export services, and routes the saved image through `PostCaptureActionHandler`.
- `AreaSelectionController` and `AreaSelectionWindow` own the cross-display overlay session, target-display keyboard ownership for screenshot sessions, and highlight rendering for both manual and application screenshot interaction modes.
- `WindowSelectionQueryService` resolves the hovered topmost app window from CoreGraphics window lists plus `SCShareableContent`, so app-mode hover stays accurate without doing expensive live queries on every draw pass.
- `PostCaptureActionHandler` executes Quick Access, clipboard copy, and screenshot auto-open in Annotate after files already exist.
- `TempCaptureManager` is where the `Save` after-capture toggle becomes real behavior. Recording uses an internal per-session processing directory first, then moves the final video to export or the temp capture root after AVAssetWriter finishes.
- `QuickAccessActionConfigurationStore` owns user-configurable Quick Access action visibility, context-menu order, and card slot assignments. Settings → Quick Access lets users reorder the context menu from the list, then drag actions onto explicit preview slots for the live hover card layout.
- `RecordingCoordinator` owns the toolbar/overlay UX. `ScreenRecordingManager` owns the media pipeline.
- `ScrollingCaptureCoordinator` is its own subsystem. Treat `Services/Capture/ScrollingCapture/*` as a unit.
- `ScrollingCaptureFrameSource` publishes timestamped region frames into `ScrollingCaptureFrameRing`, so live preview and commit/stitch decisions share one bounded frame timeline before falling back to still area capture.
- `CloudManager` is a facade. Provider-specific behavior lives under `Services/Cloud/`.
- `Shared/Localization/L10n.swift` is the bridge for user-facing copy that does not live directly in SwiftUI view literals.
- `Resources/Localization/Shared/*.xcstrings` and `Resources/Localization/Features/*.xcstrings` are the runtime localization catalogs.
- `tools/localization/CatalogTool.swift` owns audit and verify for split localization catalogs.
- `Resources/*/InfoPlist.strings` still own privacy permission text.
- Keep brand names, file formats, key labels, MIME types, and other technical tokens verbatim unless product behavior explicitly changes.

## Test Architecture

Snapzy uses peer test roots at the repository root so test code stays out of
the app source folder and Xcode can bind each root to the correct target.

- **SnapzyTests** — Unit Testing Bundle. Mirrors the `Snapzy/` source tree by
  domain, for example `SnapzyTests/Services/Capture/*Tests.swift` tests
  `Snapzy/Services/Capture/*`.
- **SnapzyUITests** — planned UI Testing Bundle for end-to-end user flows.

Current Xcode project contract:

- `Snapzy.xcodeproj` has a file-system synchronized root group for
  `SnapzyTests/`.
- The shared `Snapzy` scheme uses `Snapzy.xctestplan`, which includes
  `SnapzyTests` in its Test action.
- Test helpers live in `SnapzyTests/Helpers/`.
- Fixtures, when needed, should live in `SnapzyTests/Fixtures/`.

Do not place XCTest files under `Snapzy/`; that folder is synchronized into the
app target.

Directory structure mirrors the app: `SnapzyTests/Services/Cloud/AWSV4SignerTests.swift` tests `Snapzy/Services/Cloud/AWSV4Signer.swift`. Shared mocks and fixture assets live in `SnapzyTests/Helpers/` and `SnapzyTests/Fixtures/`.

### Test Priority

| Layer | Type | Priority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Services/Cloud/AWSV4Signer` | Unit | **P0** | Pure crypto, zero deps |
| `Services/Cloud/LifecycleXMLParser` | Unit | **P0** | Pure XML parsing |
| `Services/Capture/CaptureOutputNaming` | Unit | **P0** | Template + sanitization |
| `Shared/Extensions/` | Unit | **P0** | Pure utilities |
| `Services/Media/` | Unit | **P1** | Vision/CoreImage, needs fixture images |
| `Services/Capture/TempCaptureManager` | Unit | **P1** | File lifecycle, mock `FileManager` |
| `Services/Capture/PostCaptureActionHandler` | Unit | **P1** | Routing logic, protocol DI |
| `Services/Cloud/CloudManager` | Integration | **P2** | Facade, mock providers |
| `Features/Capture/CaptureViewModel` | Unit | **P2** | State transitions only, high coupling |
| `Features/Onboarding/`, `Features/Preferences/` | UI | **P3** | XCUITest |

### Key Constraints

- Test target needs its own entitlements (copy `Snapzy.entitlements`, drop Sparkle keys).
- Use `UserDefaults(suiteName: "SnapzyTests")` to isolate test state.
- `@MainActor` singletons (`TempCaptureManager.shared`) require `@MainActor` test methods.
- `SCShareableContent`/`SCStream` cannot be mocked — test capture logic through `CaptureOutputNaming` and `PostCaptureActionHandler` instead.
- OCR fixtures: bundle test images in `SnapzyTests/Fixtures/`, load via `Bundle(for: type(of: self))`.
- CI: GitHub Actions macOS 14+ runners have Screen Recording permission. Older runners: `try XCTSkipUnless(CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess())`.

## Current Behavior Clarifications

- `Upload to Cloud & copy link` in Preferences enables manual cloud actions in Quick Access for screenshots, videos, and GIFs, plus Annotate for screenshots; it does not auto-run inside `PostCaptureActionHandler`.
- Quick Access can outlive the original capture location: saved captures stay in the export folder, temp captures are deleted when dismissed unless the user explicitly saves them.
- Annotate, Video Editor, GIF conversion, and cloud upload pause Quick Access countdowns for the active item and resume them when the activity ends.
- During recording, the menu bar item no longer turns into a left-click stop button. It keeps the normal menu path available, adds a live timer to the status item, and exposes stop plus pause/resume from the active menu section.
- When Preferences is opened during an active recording with own-app capture enabled, Snapzy temporarily excludes that Settings window from the stream instead of forcing the user to stop recording first.
